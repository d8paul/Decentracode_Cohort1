In this session, we are demonstrating to a builder how to create an html Dapp that speaks to a backend of a deployed smart contract on the sepolia blockchain. 
### Assignment
Deploy this smart contract on the Lisk sepolia and Create this DAPP to talk to your smart Contract on Lisk Sepolia.
### Upload your sourcecode to github.
***Write about it on X and add a link to your source code. Tag Decentracode on the handle @Decentracod***

*** An HTML DApp (Decentralized Application) is a web application that interacts with a blockchain via smart contracts. Unlike traditional web apps, a DApp does not rely on a centralized backend but instead communicates with a blockchain network through smart contracts and APIs. It typically consists of:
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Smart Contract (Blockchain logic)
Web3 API (Connects frontend to blockchain)
